# Animated Discord Logo
[![Linting CI Actions Status](https://github.com/NNTin/discord-logo/workflows/Linting%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NNTin/discord-logo/actions)

This project was inspired by [Discord's loading logo](https://canary.discordapp.com/assets/0bdc0497eb3a19e66f2b1e3d5741634c.webm).

Since the loading logo is a video you have less control over its behavior. This project recreates the animated logo in **S**caleable **V**ector **G**raphics. By using **SVG**, all edges are clean and sharp. You can have any size and color. It consumes less resources compared to a video. Original SVG and color palette were retrieved from [Discord](https://discordapp.com/branding).
